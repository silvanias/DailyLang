Lisp
Lisp is today's coding language! Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language! Only Fortran is older, by one year. In lisp you can add two numbers together like so: (+ 1 2), equalling three. Can you see what would be the result of this:
(+ 3 (-5 3))?
